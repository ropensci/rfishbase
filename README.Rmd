Welcome to `rfishbase 3.0`. This package is the third rewrite of the original `rfishbase` package described in [Boettiger et al. (2012)](http://www.carlboettiger.info/assets/files/pubs/10.1111/j.1095-8649.2012.03464.x.pdf), and is not backwards compatible with the original.  The first version of `rfishbase` relied on the XML summary pages provided by FishBase, which contained relatively incomplete data and have since been deprecated.  The package later added functions that relied on HTML scraping of fishbase.org, which was always slow, subject to server instabilities, and carried a greater risk of errors.  

To address all of these issues, we created `rfishbase 2.0` accompanied by a stand-alone FishBase API with the blessing of the FishBase.org team, who have kindly provided copies of the backend SQL database to our team for this purpose.  At this time the API does not cover all tables provided by the SQL backend, but does access the largest and most commonly used.  A list of all tables available from the API (and from rfishbase) can be seen using the `heartbeat()` function.  

`rfishbase` 3.0 queries pre-compressed tables from a static server and employs local caching (through memoization) to provide much greater performance and stability, particularly for dealing with large queries involving 10s of thousands of species.  The user is never expected to deal with pagination or curl headers and timeouts.  

`rfishbase` 3.0 tries to maintain as much backwards compatibility as possible with rfishbase 2.0.  However, there are cases in which the rfishbase 2.0 behavior was not desirable -- such as throwing errors when a introducing simple `NA`s for missing data would  be more appropriate, or returning vectors where `data.frame`s were needed to include all the context.  


We welcome any feedback, issues or questions that users may encounter through our issues tracker on GitHub: [https://github.com/ropensci/rfishbase/issues].

## Getting started


[FishBase](http://fishbase.org) makes it relatively easy to look up a lot of information on most known species of fish.  However, looking up a single bit of data, such as the estimated trophic level, for many different species becomes tedious very soon. This is a common reason for using `rfishbase`.  As such, our first step is to assemble a good list of species we are interested in.

### Building a species list

Almost all functions in `rfishbase` take a list (character vector) of species scientific names, for example:

```{r}
fish <- c("Oreochromis niloticus", "Salmo trutta")
```

You can also read in a list of names from any existing data you are working with.  When providing your own species list, you should always begin by validating the names.  Taxonomy is a moving target, and this well help align the scientific names you are using with the names used by FishBase, and alert you to any potential issues:

```{r}
fish <- validate_names(c("Oreochromis niloticus", "Salmo trutta"))
```

Another typical use case is in wanting to collect information about all species in a particular taxonomic group, such as a Genus, Family or Order.  The function `species_list` recognizes six taxonomic levels, and can help you generate a list of names of all species in a given group:


```{r}
fish <- species_list(Genus = "Labroides")
fish
```

`rfishbase` also recognizes common names. When a common name refers to multiple species, all matching species are returned:

```{r}
trout <- common_to_sci("trout")
trout
```

Note that there is no need to validate names coming from `common_to_sci` or `species_list`, as these will always return valid names.

### Getting data

With a species list in place, we are ready to query fishbase for data. Note that if you have a very long list of species, it is always a good idea to try out your intended functions with a subset of that list first to make sure everything is working. 

The `species()` function returns a table containing much (but not all) of the information found on the summary or homepage for a species on [fishbase.org](http://fishbase.org). `rfishbase` functions always return [tidy](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/paper) data tables: rows are observations (e.g. a species, individual samples from a species) and columns are variables (fields).

```{r}
species(trout$Species)
```

Most tables contain many fields. To avoid overly cluttering the screen, `rfishbase` displays tables as `data_frame` objects from the `dplyr` package.  These act just like the familiar `data.frames` of base R except that they print to the screen in a more tidy fashion.  Note that columns that cannot fit easily in the display are summarized below the table.  This gives us an easy way to see what fields are available in a given table. For instance, from this table we may only be interested in the `PriceCateg` (Price category) and the `Vulnerability` of the species. We can repeat the query for our full species list, asking for only these fields to be returned:

```{r}
dat <- species(trout$Species, fields=c("Species", "PriceCateg", "Vulnerability"))
dat
```

### FishBase Docs: Discovering data

Unfortunately identifying what fields come from which tables is often a challenge.  Each summary page on fishbase.org includes a list of additional tables with more information about species ecology, diet, occurrences, and many other things.  `rfishbase` provides functions that correspond to most of these tables.  

Because `rfishbase` accesses the back end database, it does not always line up with the web display. Frequently `rfishbase` functions will return more information than is available on the web versions of the these tables. Some information found on the summary homepage for a species is not available from the `species` summary function, but must be extracted from a different table. For instance, the species `Resilience` information is not one of the fields in the `species` summary table, despite appearing on the species homepage of fishbase.org.  To discover which table this information is in, we can use the special `rfishbase` function `list_fields`, which will list all tables with a field matching the query string:

```{r}
list_fields("Resilience")
```

This shows us that this information appears on the `stocks` table.  Working in R, it is easy to query this additional table and combine the results with the data we have collected so far:


```{r}
stocks(trout$Species, fields=c("Species", "Resilience", "StockDefs"))
```


Sometimes it is more useful to search for a broad description of the tables.  


## SeaLifeBase



```{r}
species(server="sealifebase")
```

## Backwards compatibility

- Most functions should work as before.  

- You can still specify server using the rfishbase `2.x` format of providing a URL argument for server, e.g. `"http://fishbase.ropensci.org/sealifebase"` or `Sys.setenv(FISHBASE_API = "http://fishbase.ropensci.org/sealifebase")` if you prefer.
