Welcome to `rfishbase 5`! This is the fourth rewrite of the original `rfishbase` package described in [Boettiger et al. (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8649.2012.03464.x).   


Another streamlined re-design following new abilities for data hosting and access.
This release relies on a HuggingFace datasets hosting for data and metadata hosting
in parquet and schema.org.  

Data access is simplified to use the simple HuggingFace datasets API instead
of the previous contentid-based resolution. This allows metadata to be defined
with directly alongside the data platform independent of the R package.  

A simplified access protocol relies on `duckdbfs` for direct reads of tables.
Several functions previously used only to manage connections are now deprecated
or removed, along with a significant number of dependencies.

Core use still centers around the same package API using the `fb_tbl()` function,
with legacy helper functions for common tables like `species()` are still accessible and
can still optionally filter by species name where appropriate.  As before, loading the
full tables and sub-setting manually is still recommended.

Historic helper  functions like `load_taxa()` (combining the taxonomic classification from Species,
Genus, Family and Order tables), `validate_names()`, and `common_to_sci()` and 
`sci_to_common()` should be in working order, all using table-based outputs.


- `rfishbase 1.0` relied on parsing of XML pages served directly from Fishbase.org.  
- `rfishbase 2.0` relied on calls to a ruby-based API, `fishbaseapi`, that provided access to SQL snapshots of about 20 of the more popular tables in FishBase or SeaLifeBase.
- `rfishbase 3.0` side-stepped the API by making queries which directly downloaded compressed csv tables from a static web host. This substantially improved performance a reliability, particularly for large queries. The release largely remained backwards compatible with 2.0, and added more tables.
- `rfishbase 4.0` extends the static model and interface. Static tables are distributed in parquet and accessed through a provenance-based identifier. While old functions are retained, a new interface is introduced to provide easy access to all fishbase tables.

```{r include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning=FALSE, comment=NA)
options("rfishbase_local_db" = FALSE)

```


## Installation



```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results="hide", eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("ropensci/rfishbase")
```


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results="hide"}
library("rfishbase")
library("dplyr") # convenient but not required
```

## Getting started

## Generic table interface

All fishbase tables can be accessed by name using the `fb_tbl()` function:

```{r}
fb_tbl("ecosystem")
```


You can see all the tables using `fb_tables()` to see a list of all the table names (specify `sealifebase` if desired). Careful, there are a lot of them! The fishbase databases have grown a lot in the decades, and were not intended to be used directly by most end-users, so you may have considerable work to determine what's what. Keep in mind that many variables can be estimated in different ways (e.g. trophic level), and thus may report different values in different tables.  Also note that species is name (or SpecCode) is not always the primary key for a table -- many tables are specific to stocks or even individual samples, and some tables are reference lists that are not species focused at all, but meant to be joined to other tables (`faoareas`, etc).  Compare tables against what you see on fishbase.org, or ask on our issues forum for advice!


```{r}
fish <- c("Oreochromis niloticus", "Salmo trutta")

fb_tbl("species") %>% 
  mutate(sci_name = paste(Genus, Species)) %>%
  filter(sci_name %in% fish) %>% 
  select(sci_name, FBname, Length)

```


## SeaLifeBase

SeaLifeBase.org is maintained by the same organization and largely parallels the database structure of Fishbase. As such, almost all `rfishbase` functions can instead be instructed to address the 


```{r}
fb_tbl("species", "sealifebase")
```

## Versions and importing all tables

By default, tables are downloaded the first time they are used.  `rfishbase` defaults to download the latest available snapshot; be aware that the most recent snapshot may be months behind the latest data on fishbase.org. Check available releases:

```{r}
available_releases()
```
