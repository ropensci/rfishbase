\usage{
length_length(species_list = NULL, fields = NULL, query = NULL,
  limit = 200, offset = 0, server = getOption("FISHBASE_API",
  FISHBASE_API), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{species_list}{A vector of scientific names (each element as "genus species"). If empty, the table will be loaded up to the limit. This makes it possible to load an entire table without knowledge of the species in the table, thus avoiding uneccesary API calls.}

\item{fields}{a character vector specifying which fields (columns) should be returned. By default,
all available columns recognized by the parser are returned. This option can be used to limit the amount
of data transfered over the network if only certain columns are needed.}

\item{query}{a named list specifying specific subsets of fields.}

\item{limit}{The maximum number of matches from a single API call (e.g. per species). Function
will warn if this needs to be increased, otherwise can be left as is.}

\item{offset}{The record to start at. Use in combination with \code{limit}
parameter when retrieving more than 5000 results. Default: 0}

\item{server}{base URL to the FishBase API (by default). For SeaLifeBase, use http://fishbase.ropensci.org/sealifebase}

\item{...}{additional arguments to httr::GET}

a table of lengths

\description{
return a table of lengths
}
\details{
This table contains relationships for the conversion of one length type to another for over 8,000
species of fish, derived from different publications, e.g. Moutopoulos and Stergiou (2002) and
Gaygusuz et al (2006), or from fish pictures, e.g. Collette and Nauen (1983), Compagno (1984)
and Randall (1997). The relationships, which always refer to centimeters, may consist either of a
regression linking two length types, of the form:
 Length type (2) = a + b x Length type (1)
Length type (2) = b' x Length type (1)
The available length types are, as elsewhere in FishBase,
TL = total length;
FL = fork length;
SL = standard length;
WD = width (in rays);
OT = other type (to be specified in the Comment field).
When a version of equation (1) is presented, the length range, the number of fish used in the regression,
the sex and the correlation coefficient are presented, if available.
When a version of equation (2) is presented, the range and the correlation coefficient are omitted,
as the ratio in (2) will usually be estimated from a single specimen, or a few fish covering a narrow
range of lengths.
