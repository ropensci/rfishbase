\usage{
popgrowth(species_list = NULL, fields = NULL, query = NULL, limit = 200,
  offset = 0, server = getOption("FISHBASE_API", FISHBASE_API), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{species_list}{A vector of scientific names (each element as "genus species"). If empty, the table will be loaded up to the limit. This makes it possible to load an entire table without knowledge of the species in the table, thus avoiding uneccesary API calls.}

\item{fields}{a character vector specifying which fields (columns) should be returned. By default,
all available columns recognized by the parser are returned. This option can be used to limit the amount
of data transfered over the network if only certain columns are needed.}

\item{query}{a named list specifying specific subsets of fields.}

\item{limit}{The maximum number of matches from a single API call (e.g. per species). Function
will warn if this needs to be increased, otherwise can be left as is.}

\item{offset}{The record to start at. Use in combination with \code{limit}
parameter when retrieving more than 5000 results. Default: 0}

\item{server}{base URL to the FishBase API (by default). For SeaLifeBase, use http://fishbase.ropensci.org/sealifebase}

\item{...}{additional arguments to httr::GET}
}
\value{
a table of population growth information by species; see details
}
\description{
This table contains information on growth, natural mortality and length
at first maturity, which serve as inputs to many fish stock assessment
models. The data can also be used to generate empirical relationships
between growth parameters or natural mortality estimates, and their
correlates (e.g., body shape, temperature, etc.), a line of research
that is useful both for stock assessment and for increasing understanding
of the evolution of life-history strategies
